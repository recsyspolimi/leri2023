The **Workshop on Learning and Evaluating Recommendations with Impressions (LERI)** will focus on all aspects related to leveraging impression data to build and evaluate a recommendation engine. The goal is to both help to coalesce researchers exploring the use of impressions from different perspectives, as well as foster increased interest from the community for this new and still largely underexplored topic that has the potential of impacting the field in several ways. 

The workshop aims to provide a venue for researchers and practitioners to come together in order to: (i) share experience and lessons learned; (ii) identify key challenges in the area; (iii) build a common mental model and conceptual framework for thinking and researching on the use of impressions; (iv) identify emerging topics and new opportunities. The workshop also aims to lay bridges between practitioners and academics, encourage a wider availability of impression data sources and leverage industry's experience to guide and inform academic research. 

LERI 2023 is the 1st edition of the Workshop on Learning and Evaluating Recommendations with Impressions (LERI) Workshop. It will take place from September the 18th to September the 23rd, 2023 in conjunction with ACM RecSys 2023, Singapore.
